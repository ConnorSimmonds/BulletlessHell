# BulletlessHell
A small game written in Processing done for university and as a personal challenge for optimization. Processing can handle roughly 2,240 bullets doing a sin wave pattern before it starts to lag to a point where it impacts play.

The game itself contains a high score table saved to a local file, a basic stage and boss, and basic animation on the player.
